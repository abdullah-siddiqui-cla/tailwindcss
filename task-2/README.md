Build a Responsive Pricing Card with Hover Effects

## Goal
Create a responsive pricing card with Tailwind CSS that displays the features and price of a service or product. The card should have hover effects that emphasize it as an active selection.

See `preview.mov` for the visual reference.

## Requirements:
### 1. Create the Card Layout
Use a div container with a maximum width (max-w-md) and center it on the page.
Add padding, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow for a clean look.

### 2. Add Pricing Information
Add a title (h2), such as "Pro Plan," with bold text and a medium font size.
Add a price section (h3) with larger text for emphasis.
Use smaller text for a "per month" or "per year" label.

### 3. List Features
Add a list of features (ul and li elements) inside the card.
Style the list to make each feature stand out (e.g., add icons or adjust font size and color).

### 4. Add a Call-to-Action Button
Add a button or link that says "Choose Plan" with background color, padding, and rounded corners.
Apply a hover effect that changes the background color and adds a subtle shadow.

### 5. Add Hover and Transition Effects
On hover, slightly increase the card's shadow intensity and scale it up.
Add transition effects for a smooth transformation when hovering.

### 6. Make it Responsive
Ensure the cardâ€™s layout looks good on both small and large screens by adjusting padding, font sizes, and positioning.
