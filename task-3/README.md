# Exercise: Build a Responsive Image Gallery with Tailwind CSS Grid
## Goal
Create a responsive image gallery using Tailwind CSS. The gallery should display images in a grid layout, with the number of columns adjusting based on the screen size.

See `preview-desktop.png` and `preview-mobile.png` for a reference.

## Requirements:
### 1. Set Up the Grid Layout
Use a div container with Tailwind's grid classes to define a grid layout for the gallery.
Set different numbers of columns based on screen size (e.g., 1 column on small screens, 2 on medium, and 3 or 4 on large screens).

### 2. Add Gallery Items
Populate the grid with images by adding `img` elements inside the grid container.
Use utility classes to control the image appearance, such as setting width, height, and rounded corners.

### 3. Add Hover Effects
Apply hover effects to each image, such as increasing brightness, scaling up, or adding a shadow.
Spacing and Styling:

### 4. Use gap utilities (gap-x, gap-y, or gap) to add space between the images
Add padding and a background color to the main container for better visual separation
