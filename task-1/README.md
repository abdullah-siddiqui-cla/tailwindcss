# Exercise: Build a Responsive Profile Card

## Goal
Create a simple, responsive profile card using Tailwind CSS. The card should display user information like a profile picture, name, title, description, and a link or button.

See `preview-desktop.png` and `preview-mobile.png` for a reference.

## Requirements

### 1. Set up Tailwind
Set up a local HTML file with Tailwind integrated. You can use https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn link for installing the tailwindcss in your HTML file.

### 2. Create the Card Layout
Make a div container with a maximum width of sm (small) and center it on the page.
Give the card a shadow, padding, and rounded corners.

### 3. Add a Profile Picture
Use an img element and add utility classes to make it a circular, responsive image.
Set the width and height using Tailwind utilities (e.g., w-24 h-24).

### 4. Add User Information
Add an `h2` element for the name and style it with a larger font size and bold weight.
Add a `p` element for the title with a smaller font size and lighter color.
Add another `p` element for a short bio or description.

### 5. Add a Call-to-Action Button
Add a button or link styled with Tailwind classes for background color, padding, rounded corners, and hover effects.

### 6. Make it Responsive
Adjust the cardâ€™s layout to look good on both small and large screens (e.g., by adjusting padding, font size, and positioning).
